# Infrastructure as Code Pathway

## Terraform Exercises
1. Use a count argument to add the ability to create multiple resources, each with a unique name.
2. Deploy an availability set (Azure only).
3. Deploy virtual machines into availability set (Azure only).
4. Convert to a module which allows for the deployment to multiple regions.
5. Add locals to allow for calculations in each deployment, this can help with naming etc.
6. Add logic to decide when to create an availability set using conditional expressions (Azure only)
7. Enable the provisioning across multiple availability zones, with even resource deployment

### Required Prerequisites
- Download of an approciate editor e.g VSCode
- Understanding of basic cloud concepts (AWS & Azure)
- Understanding of AWS VPC & Azure Virtual Network networking

### Learning Objectives
1. Use count arguments within terraform to create multiple resources and provide unique naming
2. Understand the concept of a module within Terraform
3. Understanding of Terraform functions
4. Understand the concept of locals within a Terraform module
5. The use of conditional expressions to add logic into modules
6. The use of maps within variables

|   v6    | Add a count argument to create multiple virtual machines, ensuring unique naming                                                                                               | AWS & Azure |
|   v7    | Add an availability set resource                                                                                                                                               | Azure       |
|   v8    | Add VMs to the availability set, which must be done at creation                                                                                                                | Azure       |
|   v9    | Convert to a module so it's possible to deploy into multiple regions for redundancy. <br> For Azure, this can be achieved via a for_loop, however this is not possible via AWS | AWS & Azure |
|   v10   | Use of locals to calculate values, and use of region as a unique identifier for naming resources                                                                               | AWS & Azure |
|   v11   | Add a conditional expression to decide when to create an availability set                                                                                                      | Azure       |
|   v12   | Add a conditional expression to decide when to add VMs to an availability zone, and ensuring each VM is in a different zone (up to maximum available)                          | AWS & Azure |
